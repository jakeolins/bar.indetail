                p <strong>The Bar, in Detail</strong> is a free service that connects people who are interested in making better cocktails with professional bartenders that provide guidance, recipes and tradecraft.  The interactions between patrons and bartenders happen anonymously over text.  
                p Simply text (312) 500 2798, answer two automated questions, and we'll connect you to a bartender in our network with the expertise you are looking for.
                p Our bartenders are talented, experienced professionals, many of whom have had their employment impacted by COVID-19.
                p If you enjoy their suggestions, we make it easy to tip via

                    p ...almost as if you were in a real bar (remember those?).

                p We also license our proprietary and highly customizable texting service, inDetail, to bars, restaurants and liquor stores who want to enable their staff to interact with their customers and followers via text.
